  rxs_stun
  --------

  Experimental stun code to test router hole punching. At this moment
  we're only focussing on the bare minimum implementation of STUN to 
  make rxs_streamer work easily while testing.

  With stun you send some packets to a STUN server who replies with information
  about the IP:PORT from which the packets were received and detects the type of NAT 
  device trhough which the packets were sent. The STUN client uses this information
  so that external contacts can reach them withouth the need of manual port 
  forwarding. This doesn't work with all NATs; only will so called "full-cone"
  NATs.

  Stun messages:
  --------------
  - message class: 
    - request
    - success response
    - failure response
    - indication
   - transactions: 
     - request/response transations
         - response: success or error
     - indication, one way 


  Testing:
  --------

  Once you got a reply from the stun server you test if the port is 
  correctly forwarded by sending some test UDP packets using netcat: 

     echo -n "hello" | nc -4u -w1 home.roxlu.com 19302

  Keep Alive
  ----------

  From RFC 5245, Section 10:

          If STUN is being used for keepalives, a STUN Binding Indication is
          used [RFC5389].  The Indication MUST NOT utilize any authentication
          mechanism.  It SHOULD contain the FINGERPRINT attribute to aid in
          demultiplexing, but SHOULD NOT contain any other attributes.  It is
          used solely to keep the NAT bindings alive.  The Binding Indication
          is sent using the same local and remote candidates that are being
          used for media.  Though Binding Indications are used for keepalives,
          an agent MUST be prepared to receive a connectivity check as well.
          If a connectivity check is received, a response is generated as
          discussed in [RFC5389], but there is no impact on ICE processing
          otherwise.
