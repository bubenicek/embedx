/** \page roxml-tune tuning libroxml
 *
 * Being dedicated to embedded systems, libroxml include the ability to tune its behaviour.
 * files \file roxml-tune.h, \file roxml-tiny.h and \file site.in are used for that purpose.
 * 
 * \section tune <roxml-tune>
 * This file describe all options that can be used. Each consist of a #define CONFIG_XML_xxx set to
 * either 0 or 1. This file describes default values and should not be modified but to had options. 
 *
 * This file also implements some tuning options. We try not to use #defines all over the code except 
 * to activate or remove some portion. Instead, we do define macros.
 *
 * \section tune_end </roxml-tune>
 *
 * \section mk <site.mk>
 * This file is actually not handled in the source control system. The sample site.in is provided. Creating the site.mk
 * file in the libroxml root directory will automagically turn the USER DEFINED CONF behaviour.
 * Users should activate or remove options using this file.
 * All options are describer into file \file roxml-tune.h
 *
 * \section mk_end </roxml.mk>
